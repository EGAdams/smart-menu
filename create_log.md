Act as an expert Python developer.

I want a quick and easy logging system.

I want to run the Python program and the 1st thing that it does is ask me what the log should be.

Once the log is entered, for example "starting to debug system", the Python program will create a log file with the contents of the log.  A log file should be named like this: `may_16_2024_150730`.  This file name has the current date plus the time at the end "150730" which is 3:07:30 PM.

Please create this Python program.
